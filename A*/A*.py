# Use case for Euclidean distance heuristic

# If the edges between nodes in a graph are straight lines, 
# then Euclidean distance is a valid heuristic and it will never over estimate the distance
# between any two nodes of the graph. 

# The heuristic distance can not over estimate the distance between a node in a graph
# and the goal node. The shortest distance between two points on a 2d plane is a straight line, and given two points
# on a 2d plane, the Euclidean distance is the magnitude of the straight line between these two points.

# As seen on the map diagram, the edges between the nodes are straight lines, this justifies using the Euclidean
# distance heuristic

# I found the provided notebook for Dijkstra's algorithm a good reference for solving this problem, A* is similar
# except there is more information provided from the heuristic distance from a node to the goal node
# which influences the sequence of explored nodes

# I looked at this wikipedia article to get ideas for this task https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search

    # So the Manhattan distance metric will have to be adjusted to be a valid
